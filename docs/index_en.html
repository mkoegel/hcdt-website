            <p class="quote">"Fail often so you can succeed sooner" </p>
            <p class="autor">- Tom Kelley</p>
            <p>Design Thinking is an approach to solving problems and developing new ideas. The goal is to find solutions
                that are convincing from the user's point of view. In contrast to other innovation methods, Design Thinking
                can or is sometimes not described as a method or process, but rather as an approach based on the three
                equally important basic principles of team, space and process.</p>

            <p class="autor">- Steve Jobs</p>
            <p>User Experience (UX), User Interface (UI), Service Design, Customer Experience (CX) are just a few of the
                terms you will encounter when dealing with design. In the end, it's always about the experience of the
                people with whom I always start my work. That's why I call it Experience Design</p>

            <p>Digital transformation requires a change in the way we work. Becoming more agile and innovative affects
                the entire organization and not just individual employees. With a lot of experience in agile working and
                the broad view of the systemic organizational developer, I help you to pave your own way.</p>

                <p>My offers are always based on your specific needs and are as individual as your company. To ensure that

                    free initial consultation. </p>

                <p>For larger projects, I work in phases so that you have the opportunity to make adjustments after each
                    phase or terminate the project if necessary. This keeps the entire process flexible and transparent.</p>

                <p>Feel free to make an appointment for a non-binding initial consultation - I look forward to getting to
