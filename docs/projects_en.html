    <h2>Innovation training for journalists in the arab speaking region</h2>

      <img src="images/InnovateToInvestigate.webp" alt="InnovateToInvestigate">
      <p>In October 2021, I provided innovation training for interdisciplinary teams of journalists, fact checkers, lawyers,
        human rights activists, developers, and designers for the ARIJ Network and the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Peace
        to prepare them for their work in the #InnovateToInvestigate Inncubator. This was the first time I was able to gain
        experience with simultaneous translation in online trainings.</p>

    <h2>AHAckathon for humanitarian logistic in the ASEAN region</h2>
    <div id="project2-details">
      <p>On the initiative of Kühne HELP Logistics and in cooperation with launchlabs Berlin, I conducted the AHAckathon
        for humanitarian logistics for the AHA Centre in Jakarta. The AHA Centre coordinates crisis operations in the whole
        ASEAN region and has formulated 6 challenges on which student teams from all over the region worked online for 3 days.
        In addition to the launchlabs virtual studio, MURAL was used as an online whiteboard and Discord as a communication
        platform for the teams. 6 Impact Week coaches from Jordan, Nepal, Germany and New Zealand accompanied the teams throughout.</p>

    <h2>Innovation with Design Thinking at an international engineering company</h2>
    <p>In the project I created a strategic roadmap together with the AppHaus team. This involved linking the empowerment
      of the design thinking team at the client with a parallel first lighthouse project for spare parts management.
      As the User Experience Lead, I worked with the designers to conduct user research in several service branches in Turkey,
      Singapore and Hong Kong. The results were evaluated in several customer workshops, processed and presented to the management.
      The resulting prototype was tested for feasibility together with development experts and a concrete development plan was created.
      Since then, the customer's team has been working successfully with the Design Thinking method in many other projects.

    <h2>Red Dot Award for Medical Research Insights</h2>
    <p>The Medical Research Insights project, which was carried out in cooperation with the SAP Innovation Center Potsdam
      (development) and the Heidelberg University Hospital (customer), is a typical example of the user-centered solutions
      that I have designed with the team in recent years. The first step is always to get to know the people involved,
      the work environment and processes through inspections and interviews. In this case it was particularly important
      that the cancer researchers found themselves in their technical language and way of thinking. <br>
      A design was iteratively done with the customer and the development team and validated several times with end users
      in several workshops that were co-led. I contributed with my ability to translate between development, design and specialist area. <br>
      In addition to the Red Dot Award, the resulting solution has also won several other design awards.<br>
